<h3> Welcome to Pay It Forward! 🤝 <br></h3>
<div align="center">
  We know it can be difficult to find food, help, and support when you’re out of luck. Using the map below ⬇️, you can find local business allies near you that will provide food, temporary shelter, and other services! Click on the pins 📍 for the different locations to find out more about each business.
  <br><br>
  (For those that are non-business community allies, please feel free to click on the pins and click the “Pay It Forward” link — it’ll take you to a page where you can donate money 💰 to participating businesses to help fund their support efforts! 👍 Each business will specify a suggested donation amount that will help cover meals for at least one person in your community). <br>
